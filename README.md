#### What was your role / which stories did you work on
I worked on the database and connecting it to the sign up and log in buttons. I
also worked on the User Context to get User Id across screens.

+ What was the biggest challenge? 
  + The biggest  challenge was getting the database to work
+ Why was it a challenge?
  + I wasn't sure how to work the expo SQLite database
  + The documentation was very confusing to understand at first
  + I got help from a youtube video using expo SQLite to help work the database
+ Favorite / most interesting part of this project
  + When I got the database working, it was fun creating the different insert and select functions for the others to use
+ If you could do it over, what would you change?
  + I would try to get the database working earlier so that I could help with the frontend of the app
+ What is the most valuable thing you learned?
  + Use your resources to get help early so that I could focus on other parts of the project

#### What was your role / which stories did you work on

+ What was the biggest challenge?
  + My biggest challenge is to how to start a project
+ Why was it a challenge?
  + I did not know who was supposed to get the files posted into github
  + I did not know the proper procedure to push files into github. This is got around with the use of Github Desktop's push function
  + Expo is not an app where there is a site with button to download it. Had to run it through console
  + The process of setting up android studio and environment variables is complicated. This is solved through expo's instructions on website
+ Favorite / most interesting part of this project
   + The most favorite part is the animals page
+ If you could do it over, what would you change?
   + I should communicate with my teammates much more often to do things earlier
+ What is the most valuable thing you learned?
   + I should ask for help or look for help

## Conclusion

- How successful was the project?
  - We managed to get a working app that can pull from an API
  - We can store the content of the API to the database
  - Each user can save their own information on their own accounts
- What was the largest victory?
  - One of the largest victories was getting the API to work as it wasn't returning anything for a while
  - Getting the database to work as we could not open it for a while
- Final assessment of the project
  - We got most of what we set out to do
  - There were some functions that we did not get to implement in the app in the end
  - We did well to communicate what needed to be done and what we should avoid doing
